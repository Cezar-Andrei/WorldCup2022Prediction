Combining my passion for football and python, I was able to implement a code that predicts the winner of the World Cup, based on the information provided via Wikipedia, using mainly the points accumulated by each team since 1930 (the first year of the WC).
The project uses libraries such as "BeautifulSoup" for web scraping, "Pandas" for data processing and Pickle for allowing my data to be stored in databases.
The prediction is made using a custom rule-based algorithm that scores and ranks teams based on historical performance, simulating the process since the group stage of the tournament.
All steps, from data extraction to prediction logic, are implemented in Python and structured for clarity and future extensibility.
The main change that'll be made to this project is updating it for the upcoming World Cup in 2026, after all the teams/fixtures will be decided, with the estimated date of March 2026 for the teams chosen and December 2026 for the fixtures.
